## 1. Project name

**Cookido AI — Meal Planner**

## 2. Project description

Smart and intuitive meal planning web app for Thermomix users that automates creating personalized weekly menus from the Cookido recipe library. It saves time via multi‑portion cooking, keeps diets varied, and helps reduce food waste.

- Daily plan across 4 slots: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack
- Calorie distribution per day: 20% / 30% / 30% / 20% with ±20% selection tolerance
- Multi‑portion logic: if a lunch/dinner recipe has >1 serving, it’s planned again the next day as leftovers; calories are evenly split across days
- Clear UI labels for “Cook for 2 days” (day 1) and “Leftovers” (day 2)
- Swap any planned meal for up to 3 suitable alternatives; autosave for all changes
- OAuth login via Google/Facebook

For detailed product requirements, see `.ai/prd.md`. Architectural notes and MVP rationale are in `.ai/tech-stack.md`.

## 3. Tech stack

- Astro 5 for fast sites with islands architecture
- React 19 + TypeScript 5 for interactive UI
- Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives, CVA, clsx) for composable components
- Supabase: OAuth (Google/Facebook), Postgres with RLS, Realtime, Functions
- Plan generation as a single server function (Supabase Edge Function or Astro endpoint) using a deterministic algorithm (no LLM in the critical path)
- Validation with Zod; optional LLM only for non‑critical features (e.g., textual summaries)
- Observability and safety: Sentry/Logtail, server‑side secrets, and rate limiting for generation

## 4. Getting started locally

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 22.14.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- npm (bundled with Node)

Setup:

```bash
# 1) Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cookido-ai

# 2) Use the project Node version
nvm use

# 3) Install dependencies
npm install

# 4) Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Build and preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes:
- Supabase credentials and other secrets should be provided via environment variables (not included yet).
- The plan generator should run server‑side (Edge Function or API route) close to the database for performance and consistency.

## 5. Available scripts

From `package.json`:
- `dev`: start the development server
- `build`: build for production
- `preview`: preview the production build
- `astro`: run Astro CLI directly
- `lint`: run ESLint
- `lint:fix`: fix ESLint issues
- `format`: format code with Prettier

## 6. Project scope

- In scope:
  - Responsive web application (RWD)
  - OAuth via Google/Facebook
  - Use of Cookido recipe database
  - Plan generation with multi‑portion logic
  - Interactions: status changes (planned/completed/skipped), meal swapping with suitable alternatives, autosave

- Out of scope (MVP):
  - Native app/PWA
  - Guest mode
  - User‑added custom recipes
  - Manual meal editing
  - Shopping list generation
  - Advanced dietary filters (e.g., vegan, gluten‑free)
  - Fitness tracker integrations

## 7. Project status

MVP in progress. North Star Metric: percentage of plans where users mark at least 90% of meals as completed. Q1 target: 15%. Supporting metrics include early retention, swap feature adoption, and multi‑portion usage.

## 8. License

MIT. If this repository does not yet include a `LICENSE` file, consider adding one to formalize the terms.
